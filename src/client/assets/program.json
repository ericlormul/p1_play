Through a series of exercises in text analysis that are aimed to help students understand, illuminate and physically engage with language, students will develop a new relationship with Shakespeare’s language as a source for powerful acting choices. Morning sessions include voice and movement work, stage combat and an introduction to Elizabethan dance. Afternoon sessions will focus on rehearsals of scenes and sonnets. Students will discover that acting Shakespeare requires commitment and a willingness to risk oneself to explore deeply human questions.\n\nWorkshop will culminate in a performance."}
